This repository contains the Linden Lab [autobuild](https://pypi.org/project/autobuild/) scripts required to generate a Linden Lab Autobuild package of [CEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework) (excluding the libcef_dll_wrapper, which is built elsewhere) that can be used in the Linden Lab autobuild version of [Dullahan](https://bitbucket.org/lindenlab/dullahan)
___

You will also find a batch file and shell scrfipt in the `tools` directory for building CEF from source. Rather than have documentation here get out of date, you should look in the source code of those scripts - there are plenty of comments and it should be straightforward to follow.

## Linux Build

* Setup standard autobuild build environment

* Install chromium build dependencies via `https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:build/install-build-deps.py`

* `autobuild build -A64`
