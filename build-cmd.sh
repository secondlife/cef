# The CEF branch number you want to build
# The relationship to Chrome and the versions of Chromium/CEF is complex and
# can make it difficult to find the branch number to use. This page can help:
# https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/BranchesAndBuilding.md#markdown-header-release-branches
# as can this one: https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar
# E.G. Branch 4472 represents Chromium/CEF 91.x

# The commit hash in the branch we want to
# check out from. One way to determine the hash to use is to look at the commits
# for the branch you are building - for example:
# https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/commits/branch/4472 and pick the
# commit hash the looks sensible - often something like "Update to Chromium
# version xx.x.xxxx.xx".
# This hash represents CEF version 100.0.4896.75
